# WATER-QUALITY-PREDICTION-PROJECT

Context
Access to safe drinking water is essential for health, a fundamental human right, and a critical component of effective health protection policies. This issue holds significance at the national, regional, and local levels, not only as a health concern but also as a key factor in development. In many regions, investments in water supply and sanitation have shown to yield net economic benefits, as the reduction in health risks and medical costs outweighs the expenses of implementing these interventions.

Content
The water_potability.csv file contains water quality metrics for 3,276 different water bodies. The dataset includes the following parameters:

pH Value
pH is a vital parameter for assessing the acid–base balance of water, serving as an indicator of its acidic or alkaline state. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a permissible pH range of 6.5–8.5. The current investigation observed values between 6.52 and 6.83, which fall within the WHO standards.

Hardness
Hardness is primarily caused by dissolved calcium and magnesium salts originating from geological deposits. The duration of water contact with these materials determines the hardness level. Historically, hardness was defined as water’s ability to precipitate soap due to the presence of calcium and magnesium.

Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)
Water dissolves a wide range of inorganic and organic minerals such as potassium, calcium, sodium, bicarbonates, chlorides, magnesium, and sulfates. High TDS levels contribute to unwanted taste, coloration, and mineralization of water. For drinking purposes, the desirable limit of TDS is 500 mg/L, while the maximum permissible limit is 1,000 mg/L.

Chloramines
Chloramines are disinfectants commonly used in public water systems, typically formed when ammonia is added to chlorine. According to safety standards, chlorine or chloramine levels up to 4 mg/L (4 ppm) are considered safe in drinking water.

Sulfate
Sulfates are naturally present in minerals, soil, rocks, groundwater, plants, and even food. They are widely used in the chemical industry. In freshwater, sulfate levels usually range between 3 and 30 mg/L, though concentrations as high as 1,000 mg/L may occur in some regions. In seawater, the concentration averages around 2,700 mg/L.

Conductivity
Pure water is a poor conductor of electricity; conductivity increases with ion concentration. Electrical conductivity (EC) measures the ability of dissolved ions to carry current. According to WHO guidelines, EC should not exceed 400 μS/cm.

Organic Carbon
Total Organic Carbon (TOC) measures the amount of carbon in organic compounds present in water, originating from decaying natural organic matter (NOM) or synthetic sources. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends <2 mg/L in treated drinking water and <4 mg/L in source water intended for treatment.

Trihalomethanes (THMs)
THMs are by-products formed when chlorine reacts with organic matter during water treatment. Their concentration depends on organic load, chlorine dose, and water temperature. Levels up to 80 ppm are considered safe in drinking water.

Turbidity
Turbidity measures the cloudiness of water, influenced by suspended particles. It is also used to assess wastewater discharge quality. The average turbidity observed at Wondo Genet Campus was 0.98 NTU, which is well below the WHO recommended limit of 5.0 NTU.

Potability
This indicates whether water is safe for human consumption, where 1 denotes potable (safe) and 0 denotes not potable (unsafe).
